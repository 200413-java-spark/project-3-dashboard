                    <p><strong>General Description</strong><br />The Division of Mineral Resources maintains a data
                        management system on wells regulated under the Oil, Gas and Solution Mining Law (OGSML) More
                        than 75,000 wells have been drilled in New York for oil, gas, solution salt mining,
                        stratigraphic, injection, geothermal, brine disposal, and underground gas storage. Computerized
                        records currently exist on roughly 40,000 wells, of which about 14,000 are active. All of this
                        data is created and maintained for the use of the Division, and as such is covered by a
                        disclaimer regarding the use of this data.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Data Collection Methodology</strong><br />Information is provided to the Division of
                        Mineral Resources by regulated operators through various regulatory filings. Most of the
                        information provided in this dataset comes from Annual Well Reports filed every year in the
                        spring. This information is used to regulate the oil and gas industry in New York, as well as
                        track the history of a wellbore&rsquo;s production of oil, gas, or water during its lifecycle.
                    </p>
                    <p>Production data is acquired by means of annual well reports submitted by operators to the
                        Division of Mineral Resources in the spring of each year. This data is kept confidential for six
                        months and is released to the Division&rsquo;s public website in early July. During the spring
                        reporting cycle, purchasers and transporters of oil and gas similarly report the quantity of
                        product produced during the reporting year that they either transported or purchased for
                        refining.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Statistical and Analytic Issues</strong><br />This data was collected on a per well basis
                        by each operator and supplied to the Division of Mineral Resources for verification. Not all
                        operators who are sent reports end up filing their production reports on time or to the
                        satisfaction of the Division. Through enforcement activities, late filings have been addressed
                        and added to the datasets after the fact and allow for a more complete assessment of the annual
                        production of oil and gas in New York. Late filings are added to the production dataset when the
                        most current dataset is created for distribution. Approximately 85%-90% of operators end up
                        reporting on time and to a satisfactory level. The rest are handled through enforcement
                        activities.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Limitations of Data Use</strong><br />Data reported on the Annual Well Report is presumed
                        to be accurate and is double checked against reported values from oil and gas purchasers and
                        transporters.</p>
